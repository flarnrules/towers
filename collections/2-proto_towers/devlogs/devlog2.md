Today I'd like to make a few Proto Towers.
Looks like we are starting with Proto Tower 189

1. Metadata for 189 ✅
2. Draw 189 (static 32x32) ✅
3. Metadata for 190 (animated, 8x8) ✅
4. Draw 190 (animated, 8x8) ✅

I also drew and minted 191 and 192. Next thing I need to do is 193,194,195. these are 64x64

5. 193-195 metadata.
