# post mortem - january 01, 2025

this was for the gallery piece that was facilitated by adding bio, a Cosmos Hub and Asteroid protocol community member. He might be more involved in other stuff in cosmos, but that's how I know him.

He set up a LIVE gallery for nfts or inscriptions. I created a piece that was turned into a metal plate and displayed in a gallery for something like a month. I need to look back at the details, it all feels pretty long ago tbh.

This nft needs to be minted officially - and then auctioned off. I also need to figure out a clean way to use web3 to facilitate transferral of ownership of the metal plate, because that thing is pretty cool.

Could do some sort of "burn to own" mechanism but maybe best to not over think it.

Either way, gotta get that thing minted, and then I think send the plate to the winner of the auction.

Maybe I can use the RWA contract! For a single nft. This is great!
