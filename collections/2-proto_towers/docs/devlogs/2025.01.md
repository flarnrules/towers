## figure out what proto tower id number needs to be minted

I like to go to the proto-towers marketplace on stargaze and sort by Highest ID number to check this. (https://www.stargaze.zone/m/proto-towers/tokens?sort=token_id_desc) . At first look, 378 is next.

## figure out which artwork should be proto tower 378

It looks like I've slated 379 as the physical artwork.
It also looks like I've slated 378 using the Proto Towers Art Engine.
