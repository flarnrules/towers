New month new .md file.
Haven't been actively writing devlogs in a while, which is probably a good reason for me falling behind on proto towers.
Back at it, because there's some important work to be done:

1. Mint PT 331 ✅
2. Ask some questions about Sage's castle tower. ✅
3. Mint explody tower by frogstar.
4. Create more traits for frogs.
5. Create more fly eating animations for frogs.
6. Create an xnft for frogs.
7. Create test frogs collection.
8.

Need to log more about my strategy as opposed to just doing task lists lol.
This one will be slightly different.
