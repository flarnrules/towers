# devlog 4
Monday January 8, 2024 evening:

Tonight I want to deploy 9 small 3x3 pieces that all merge to form a 'megazord' like proto tower.
the small ones will be "rangers" and will be tiny towers, that fit together to create the megazord.

1. figure out the colors I want ✅
    - 201 - green - Tommy (Evil)
    - 202 - white - Tommy (Nice)
    - 203 - pink - Kimberly
    - 204 - yellow - Trini
    - 205 - black - Zack
    - 206 - red - Jason
    - 207 - grey corner - n/a
    - 208 - blue - Billy
    - 209 - grey corner - n/a

2. figure out the dimensions ✅
   -  megazord needs to be 3x3 x 3 with some extra space. 9x9 would be the smallest... I want extra space, so maybe twice as big 18x18.

3. figure out the configuration of megazord. ✅

January 11, 2024

There's at least 2 more collabs in the pipeline, I think I'll save those for the 251-300 range.
Grapheine made one, no idea what it looks like.
SiA made one, and it's really cool. It has little fishies - I could even animate the fishies!

1. Tower of Storms by PixlGeist (241) ✅
2. A few standard mints at 64x64:
    - 242 (standard listing) ✅
    - 243 (animated, network trait, will do 3 day auction) ✅
    - 244 (standard listing - 64x64) 🔴 
    - 245 (standard listing - 64x64) ➡️
3. Clean up repo a bit. ➡️
4. Ask SiA again for some metadata and for permission to animate the fishies. ➡️
5. Better streamline/automate the minting process. ➡️
6. Combine all setup.sh scripts: ➡️
    - Need to create options for deployment type. 
    - Need revise the way I use metadata template files.
    - Essentially, the metadata file needs to be generated entirely.

# devlog 8
January 13, 2024

1. mint some Jekyll or Hyde ✅
2. record an animated tower (250) ✅
3. Another Discord tower - see 186 for example with a fresh invite link, because the old one expired (186) 🔴 ✅
3. Collabs, not in any particular order:
    - sia fishies - check metadata
    - graphein crystal tower - mint and deploy as 3 day auction 🍃
    - merlioz code generated - check in
    - randomkid lighthouse + poem - testnet to see if newline `\n` works on stargaze descriptions

3. Cerberus

    - different emojis? or some unicode character like a star or pipe | or double pipe ||
7. merlioz check-in ✅
    - checked in to see if that generative proto tower is still in the works
    - he already used some code to generate a tower with p5js, it looked actually pretty cool

Work on really cool proto tower.
This will be an interactive proto tower, where a pixel represents a person that you can control with the arrow keys.
I have most of the pieces already created:
    - an interactive grid of pixels with a controllable pixel
    - a script that creates a json with a 0 or a 1 representing walkable (1) and non-walkable (0) spaces

I need to figure out how to

# devlog 15
January 28, 2024

Been doing a lot of collection stuff lately, but these devlogs have kept me organized, so need to remember to keep doing these so I don't lose track of stuff.

Current to do list:
1. Madcat special big winner tower (307) ✅
2. A 1/1 (308) ✅
3. Fluffhead winner for creating a proposal (309) ➡️
4. Burn Proto Tower 289. ✅
5. Mint Smoking 1, Smoker 1, Smoked 1 - 309, 310, 311 ✅
6. Reach out to randomkid about BUG TOWER metadata

# devlog 16
January 29, 2024

Busy with work today couldn't make much progress.

1. mint randomkid's bug tower 312 ✅
2. create BIG WINNER tower for fluffhead creating the first proposal on proto towers DAO 313
3. make the first COLOR 1/1 in a while!!! 
 - nice work moooncakes/quasimosos-> excited to see what else you create.

4. show off 100 piece collection and tease the idea behind it.

# devlog 16
second to last day in January, will start a new february devlog in a couple of days.
Lots of non-proto tower creating happening this week. tons of focus on some complex pieces.
Discovered a bug (in my opinion) while minting "BugTower". That was interesting.
The bug is that the Stargaze frontend converts gifs->MP4s because MP4s are more efficient.
But the program used to convert (ffmpeg) does something to the final frame that truncates it's length.
So basically, if you have a gif that's 10 frames of 1 second each, the mp4 on stargaze will look like this:
- 9 frames that are 1 second
- 10th frame is 100 milliseconds (or something really short like that)
- the workaround is to make a piece that's 11 frames, where both frame 10 and 11 are the same, effectively fixing the issue.
- this seems like an unnecessary workaround if the final frame wasn't truncated.

Alright, what needs to be accomplished this week:
1. BIG WINNER tower for fluffhead, he created the very first proposal.
2. BIG WINNER tower for 306, if the winner followed the instructions. Doesn't appear there is a winner for this one.
3. Make a lot of art!

well i spent most of tonight drawing backgrounds for the cerberus nft collection I'm designing.
Not a total bust, but didn't make any progress on towers 😔
