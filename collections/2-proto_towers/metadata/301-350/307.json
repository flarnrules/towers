    "description": "This is a special prize for a big winner of one of the games embedded in the descriptions of Proto Towers nfts (‚öîÔ∏èüõ°Ô∏èüó°Ô∏è).\n\n In this case it was Madcatattack who collected all 5 of Pajon's Penaptych (id #s 264-268). The game description was on Proto Tower 269. In the description I stated that I would create an animated version of those and send it to your wallet, but upon animating... I'm not so sure that looks super cool. I think the penaptych looks good as a cluster of images, so I'm going to instead table that and make the arrangement some time later. Check in with me on a status in a couple weeks!Hope you enjoy this monolith instead Madcatattack! ‚¨õ‚¨ú",
