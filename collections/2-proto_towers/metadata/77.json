    "description": "I really need to standardize the metadata in this collection, it's getting a bit out of hand. I have a bunch of duplicate trait values because of perhaps capitalization or the order of attributes in previously minted pieces. One thing I can do moving forward is standardize the trait values -> should they be capitalized? Answer... yes. Let's Just Capitalize The First Letter Of Every Single Word In A Trait Value... like that last sentence. Also, let's make the trait_types all lowercase. Not sure why, but that's what I'm doing I guess. It's officially in the README.md file now.",
