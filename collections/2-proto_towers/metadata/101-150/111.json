  "description": "This is a 1/1 deployment, because the number 111 is special. It's just a really cool number, and a palindrome. I didn't do anything special for the first palindrome (101) but that's okay, sometimes we make mistakes -- we just gotta keep moving forward. 🌇. You may have noticed that I've been using these little city emojis... there appears to be 3 good ones: cityscape 🏙️, cityscape at dusk 🌆, and sunset 🌇. Since sunset is indistinguishable from sunrise, I can use that interchangeably. I think in the next major deployment I'll have a new trait_type called 'time of deployment'. Would you look at that... I already added it.",
