  "description": "This is a market animal proto tower. Each and every week, I publish the Flarnchain Newsletter, where I declare a 'market animal' - the market animal can really be any animal, but it typically fluctuates between bear, bull and crab. There have been bunny markets, turkey markets, goose markets, and several others. Bear and bull are the most common. I drew this with my mouse while sitting on the couch taking a break. The drawing isn't great, but that's fine, sometimes you just gotta convey a message - this week is still a bull market because Stargaze is still crushin it.",
