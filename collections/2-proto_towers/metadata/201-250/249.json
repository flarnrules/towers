    "description": "Last one tonight. I think that last one also had an error. There's some unfilled pixels in there I think. Whoops. That one was fun to draw and there were at least one or two people on the livestream watching. It definitely is a bit different with an audience, like I feel the pressure is on which is both helful and somewhat nerve wracking. Hopefully my drawing was interesting to watch get made.... In this one I was trying to create little animations as the stars, and then figure out how to manipulate those animations like copy/paste the animations themselves. I figured it out a bit, but it's still pretty clunky and I still don't have a super firm grasp on those features. I need to watch some tutorials and read the Aseprite docs some more to get a bit more proficient with Asprite.",
