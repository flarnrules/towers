    "description": "Feels good to just make a drawing of some towers... little skylines like this are sort of my comfort zone. Single layer digital painting style, I didn't want to over do it so I cut it quits after 4 'colors' even though still all shades of gray, I'm figuring out a bit how the grayscale setting works in Aseprite. You can actually pick colors, they just appear in their grayscale version when drawing, which is a pretty cool feature! Also... this is a cry for help, please mint some Jekyll or Hydes so I can use color again. I'll probably find ways to get around this rule (like smokers club items coming up, and perhaps some other little tricks). I guess it is just a self imposed rule so I don't techincally *have* to follow it, but that's no fun right?. â¬›â¬œ",
