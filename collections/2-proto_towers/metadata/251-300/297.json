  "description": "This is a blitz deployment. Not to shake out the whales anymore, but to generate a decent number of quality pieces in a short period of time to push forward the primary goal of this collection: obtain enough whitelist addresses for a 10,000 piece multimedia art collection deployment. \nI'm not going to take my time with these, but I will put in maximum effort. I'll be deploying 10 in this batch. I'll have everything set up in the .json file by running ./blitz_resize.py once the template is properly configured. All of these automations put rocketfuel on my creative process, and make it a lot easier to *just* *draw* ðŸ§¨ðŸ”¥. Also I can only use black, white and various shades of gray because Jekyll and Hyde has not minted out yet! ðŸ”²â¬›. ",
