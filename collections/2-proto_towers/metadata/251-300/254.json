    "description": "Another sigil - playing around with some of the visual cues I get when thinking about how urbit and other decentralized operating systems are architected.

Also this was grayscale again because I told myself that I would use grayscale or B&W until Jekyll or Hyde is minted out. This is the importance of having collabs, because without collab deployments, this collection is would be be very monochrome for the forseeable future â¬›â¬œ",
