    "description": "Okay made some minor revisions to the metadata that will stick around from this point on: instead of the recorded trait_type being a boolean, I've changed it to just a string where you can put whatever you want. I thought boolean would be more efficient (true or false answers only), but actually I think it just isn't what I'm going for, I should be collecting strings because strings are just cooler to work with. I think strings might be more resource intensive though. I guess you just gotta pay up for the good stuff sometimes.",
