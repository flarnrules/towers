    "name": "Proto Tower 8",
    "description": "this is the third proto tower I've drawn tonight, and probably the last one. i'm getting the hang of streamlining the process of setup->draw->mint but it's still a fairly time consuming workflow. I'd like to continue to refine the optimal environment to cut the time down to around 5 minutes of coding/admin stuff, and 5-15 minutes of drawing resulting in around 10-20 minutes per nft. That would mean 5 per day should take about 1 hour. then once i have around 100, i can start mixing and matching, and get a nice generative work flow where i can create around 100-200 per week. then i think the 10,000 piece collection will be a bit more feasable.",
