    "description": "Workflow has expanded to 10 at a time, now that I've discovered that Stargaze Studio allows one to append multiple nfts in a bulk transaction. This is not super obvious on the UI, but you can just select more than 1 image and more than 1 metadata file when appending to the 1/1 collection, and boom! Bulk minting. Also, to streamline the process I've assigned each of this next batch a background pattern prior to making the drawing. These background patterns are assigned from already existing pattern values. This one is 'Circle of Grids'.",
