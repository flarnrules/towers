    "description": "This is proto tower 6, the first proto tower where I've tried to record how long it takes to draw one... and subsequently it had a major impact on the amount of time and overthinking went into drawing it... like a sort of schroedinger's proto towe - -  observation impacts the outcome sort of deal. I'm not even sure if that's the right reference, or if it's some other physics-meets-psychology kind of thing. anyways, this one has a new trait type: recorded, which is a bool, the first of many. Recorded has a `true` value if i recorded drawing it, and a `false` value if i didn't record it. This is different than the other new trait `time in minutes` which is the amount of time in minutes it took to draw. this particular is just an integer representing minutes, rounded to the nearest minute.
