    "description": "So this is the last of the 5 in this batch, and I actually think it's the strongest design of the bunch. I could see myself remixing this as a 16x16 and again as a 32x32 in the future, there's a lot of interesting stuff you could do with this one. Also the first of the batch with a different background pattern from 'sun', in this case it's 'moon' because... i dunno what else a blue square in the sky represents.",
