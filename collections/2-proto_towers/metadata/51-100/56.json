I looking forward to creating some animated gifs in this collection... those will take a bit longer so I'll need to make sure the json is configured correctly to ensure high rarity scores. Oh I also refactored the bulk resize python script, which is much more efficient and eliminated two steps, the first step it eliminated was the need to move original drawings to a 'bulk_resize' folder, and the second step it eliminated was the need to rename the files once they have been resized.",
