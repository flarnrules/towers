  "description": "This is just a 1/1 that skips Proto Tower 87 to get the nft id on stargaze back in sync. Early on I had to burn one of the minted nft's because it was an improper upload... this threw the entire collection out of syn, so Proto Tower 86 has an nft id number on the stargaze marketplace of 87. Skipping the name `Proto Tower 87` should recitfy this and get the collection back in sequence. Hooray!ðŸŽ†",
