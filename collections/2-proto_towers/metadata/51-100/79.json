    "description": "This is a Standard deployment, which comes in batches of 5. Sometimes the batches have themes, other times they are just random pulled from what's in my head at the time. Standard deployments have the same dimensions for each piece in the deployment. I slightly modified the timelapse command, by including a `~/` before the target directory, so that the command can be run from any of the directories or subdirectories within the `towers` repo. pretty pleased with that little Quality of Life  improvment.",
