    "description": "I kind of liked this minimal design, until i did the background. couldn't really figure out how to make the background work in a way that made me feel happy, but sometimes you just gotta say... eh... not my best work. I like the concept of the background, and the concept of the foreground. This design is coming back in the future, but hopefully with improved implementation.",
