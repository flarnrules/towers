    "name": "Proto Tower 5",
    "description": "This is the 5th proto tower. holding this gives the holder access to the Towers whitelist. this tower also introduces a new background pattern: 'clouds'. Once I have enough background styles, I am going to try and expand the background pattern trait into it's own set of traits and layers so that the background is generated in most of the proto towers. This will speed up the creation of the whitelist art and json data. foregrounds I feel like will be a bit more tricky ",
