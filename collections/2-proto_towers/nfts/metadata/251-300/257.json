    "description": "This is a special prize for a big winner of one of the games embedded in the descriptions of Proto Towers nfts (‚öîÔ∏èüõ°Ô∏èüó°Ô∏è).\n In this case it was Ajk_ajk who first identified several issues with the metadata and actual art of 3 othwerwise pretty cool Proto Towers: 247, 248, and 249. The game description was on 250. It took Ajk_ajk like... 10 minutes to correctly identify the errors, so looks like people are paying attention. I guess Fluffhead (previous uncontested winner of several other games) was at the supermarket or something.\n The winner also let me know that their favorite proto tower is Proto Tower 59, so I tried to create something similar, but this time in grayscale due to the current personal constraints I've put on this collection. Hope you enjoy it Ajk_ajk!\n PS: Mint some Jekyll or Hyde NFTs if you would like me to start using color again. ‚¨õ‚¨ú",
