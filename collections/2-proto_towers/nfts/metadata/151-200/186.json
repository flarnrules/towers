  "description": "I drew this while setting up the Proto Towers Discord community. There was an option to add a custom graphic that was at minimum 72x72 pixels, so I drew this tower as the custom graphic. Then the image failed to upload during the preliminary community setup so I'll need to go back to that and figure out what went wrong. btw, consider hopping over on the discord. This invite link is good for the next 7 days, hope to see you around! https://discord.gg/DqzrYC6J",
