  "description": "Quick little animation for number 200. Can't believe we are already at 200 Proto Towers! Here's to the next 200.🗼🏭🏗️🏢. In this tower I made the smoke stack of a factory the 'tower' and created a little system where there's a wastewater filtration pond that releases the water, and concides with the smokstack producing smoke, or perhaps some steam. This was a lot of fun, and I'm looking forward to seeing how far I can take this concept, especially for when I really get into my next book 'Networks, Monoliths, Megaliths and Modular Systems' which will hopefully be completed before the end of 2026.",
