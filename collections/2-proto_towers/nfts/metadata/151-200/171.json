  "description": "This proto tower is a 16x16 template that displays the colors from the Google UI color Palette. It's more of a tool than anything, but it also looks cool. It also shows how much using the Google UI color Palette is such a huge advantage. The colors are so numerous and well organized, it makes it a lot easier to do gradients and bright, rich color schemes. It's not the most interesting color scheme, but most certainly (at least for me) it's the easiest to use ðŸŸ¥ðŸŸ§ðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ¦ðŸŸªðŸŸ£â¬›ðŸ”³â¬œ. It works well as a tool because for png files, the color *needs* to be on the canvas. You can't save the color scheme because that would require you to save the file as an .aseprite file, creating more steps in the process.",
