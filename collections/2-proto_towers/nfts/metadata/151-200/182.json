  "description": "For those of you paying attention, I botched the metadata on Proto Tower 181... I forgot to change it's name. Because I didn't use the setup script - - either ./blitz_setup.sh, ./standard_setup.sh or ./collab_setup.sh, there's more room for human error in the metadata. The problem with creating a script for each and every type of setup is that the templates for those setups *also* need to be changed. However... I could create a script that makes sure all of the templates are up to date as I work through the collection, and a scrip that manages all of the scripts, I'll need to think about how best to set that up. These little metadata errors can be corrected through a somewhat complex process that I haven't done yet, but I'm going to try and figure out over the weekend. So not all is lost. These little *bugs* could be discovered and helped to be fixed by Proto Tower holders for a bug bounty. The first one was actually already fixed - I sent a prize to the wrong wallet, and another user alerted me and helped me rectify the issue. That user received a Starchoadz nft for their efforts. ü™≤",
