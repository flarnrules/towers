  "description": "This is a Standard deployment, with an exciting build-up. Immediately following this deployment, I'll be creating an animated peice, and then I'll be attempting something pretty interesting. I hope I can be efficient enough with 196,197,198, and 199 to get to the good stuff quickly. I'll be going with 16x16 for this deployment with the following backgrounds. Sky, Substrate, Sun, Stamp ~ all traits start with S. This isn't even true anymore. I actually changed Substrate to Vertical Grandient... I also added a new trait_type called 'vibe' which is more closer to a true name of the piece, but also a good sense of the proto towers meta to expect or to guide the direction of the piece I draw. I think this will greatly assist in reigning in and organizing some of the artworks so they start to look more cohesive, or so they can be categorized better into little sub collections. I also decided to make a simple animation on this one because it just seemed right.",
