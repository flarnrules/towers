    "description": "The last of this batch, I think the proto towers outline started off nice with a sort of pyramid and desert vibe, but I definitely struggled with the limited pallette of MS Paint. I'll need to use a trait value called 'custom' to open up the opportunities on MS Paint when I'm restricted to this raster graphics tool. Also, I got a kick out of adding lots of clouds to a desert sky. I feel like this is a fun little mismatch, based on my brain's idea of what a desert sky looks like... this ain't it. I'm pleased with this one, hope you are too!",
