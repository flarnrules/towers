    "name": "Proto Tower 14",
    "description": "This is the 14th proto tower, and another on the road during the 2023 holiday season. as a result, I drew this using Microsoft Paint, with a mouse. I also needed to use the python script that is included in the meta data of proto tower 13 to scale the image from 64x64 pixels to 768x768 pixels. I should probably experiment with that script a bit in future pieces, and also i think it might work better to automate the process a bit.",
