    "description": "This one was fun to draw, after I sorted out an enormous amount of pain associated with git and github. I learned to always make sure I commit and push my changes on one computer before hopping over to another computer and working. undoing commits and pushes to github is really complicated. I also don't quite understand how `git reverse` and `git revert` work correctly, but I think I learned some stuff. Specifically the command `git reflog` which gives the history of all commits in the repo.",
