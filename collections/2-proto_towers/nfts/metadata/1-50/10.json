    "name": "Proto Tower 10",
    "description": "this is the second of a duel set, and the 5th tonight. this took a bit longer because i made a small mistake and multipled the 64x64 grid by 12,000% instead of 1,200%, and ended up with some huge files that I almost uploaded -- so I had to re-export both images. Anyways, doing the art at first for two was much faster than doing the entire sequence for each one at a time. I think for proto towers 11-15 I'll make 5 drawings, then create the metadata, then mint them on-chain and see if that can be done in less that 1 hour ",
