	"description": "Hoodoos are distinctive rock formations located at Bryce Canyon National Park in Southwestern Utah. As a matter of fact Bryce Canyon National Park is the home of the *largest* collection of hoodoos in the world. \n\nOne of the most notable features of hoodoos are the multicolored sandstone bands, which look like painted stripes. Alghough I've never personally seen any hoodoos, I've seen pictures and videos of them, and I look forward to one day being lucky enough to see them in person. \n\n This peice was inspired by my older brother, Tommy Cheezeburger, who suggested that hoodoos kind of look like towers, and might work as an interesting proto tower. ‚õ∞Ô∏è",
