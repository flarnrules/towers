  "description": "Some pulsing stars. While creating this one I discovered the feature in Aseprite where you can move the animation pane to a vertical column on the left, rather than the horizontal portion on the bottom. Really made it easier to vizualize some stuff, so excited about this new little unlock in productivity.‚≠ê \n \n \n‚öîÔ∏èüõ°Ô∏èüó°Ô∏è\nPS, did anyone notice the special hidden surprise on PT304? \n Tweet @flarnrules1 if you noticed the surprise, with evidence, before the termination of this three day auction AND hold Proto Tower 306 in your wallet, and you will win a big prize!\n\n\nüìúüìúüìú\n Prize is a Proto Tower to be delivered within the next fortnite. The BIG WINNER may need to remind me what it was for. You can learn more or ask questions about what this is in the official proto towers discord: https://discord.gg/9MTWyjq2wk \n‚ö†Ô∏èthe above discord link grants 'temporary' membership in the Proto Towers discord, you will need to get a role to be come permanent, and most of the time you can just get one by showing you hold a Proto Tower. I'll set up some token gating eventually...",
