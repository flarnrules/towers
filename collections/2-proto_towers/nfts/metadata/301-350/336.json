	"description": "This was another livestream, which I love doing even though my internet has been kind of spotty recently on my sort of 'art computer' so I'll need to investigate that. I should perform some maintenance on my set up to make sure that everything is running nicely. I should also probably run a hardline to my rig instead of using wifi, I think that would be a lot better experience for livestreams. \n\nAnyways, this drawing is not my best, but I definitely had fun drawing it and I think I spent some time drawing an actual block in 3 dimensional space and tried to actually use perspective rules rather than just 'going with what i like'. I find that my drawings are actually less convincing when I'm *really trying* to use perspective, but that probably is only true for pieces where I don't draw any vanising points, horizon line, or guidelines. \n\nWhen I use those tools I tend to have better perspective. But I personally think that I excel more in the sort of 'flat on' view approach. Anyways, I'm just trying to explain away a somewhat poor drawing, when I truly did enjoy drawing it... we shouldn't be ashamed of our drawings.üñºÔ∏è",
