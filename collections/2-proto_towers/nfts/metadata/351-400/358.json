	"description": "I'm currently on a ski trip and very inspired by the mountains and just scale of everything. I also had some margaritas and am heavily influenced by the altitude, so drawing this on my laptop was a bit of a different experience. It's like my brain is moving through molassas, but it's still enjoyable to create. This piece was fun too because I haven't done a digital painting with no supporting tech in a while. I'm used to all of the bells and whistles of aseprite, so using MS Paint was an enjoyable little break from the tech and more of a stream of consciousness style proto tower, like some of the early ones.",
