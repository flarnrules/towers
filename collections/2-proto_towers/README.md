This is proto towers. a multimedia collection of proto towers, minted as IPFS links and metadata hosted on the Stargaze blockchain.

Proto towers is important, because it is the beginning.

What do we have in this directory right now?
Hey how do I use Obsidian to make this work better...

This is an exercise in learning how to develop little ways to automate the boring stuff.

And just... get right into the interesting stuff.
But sometimes *building* the tools to get there is more interesting than the origin *or* destination.

# DIRECTORY STRUCTURE ##
########################

Structure works like this.

The repo name is Towers, there are 4 subdirectories.

1. collections
2. media
3. utilities
4. web_stuff

I only really know what's in collections and utilities right now. I've basically forgotten what's inside web_stuff entirely, and media probably has some original drawings or generated pieces of art for the main collection. 

Speaking of that... I should probably also use those pieces as Proto Towers, as long as I know for sure they aren't gonna be minted in the main collection, or modify them in some way. This could make it easy to mint one on a day where perhaps I'm too busy to do a bunch of art, I could just run some special command and it mints from a big pile of old concept art at random. That would be really cool.
