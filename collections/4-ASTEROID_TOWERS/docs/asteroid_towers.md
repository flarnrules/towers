# asteroid towers
These are digital paintings that have been incribed on the Cosmos Hub blockchain.
They follow the following naming convention:

ASTEROID_TOWER_1
ASTEROID_TOWER_10
ASTEROID_TOWER_100
ASTEROID_TOWER_1000

ASTEROID_TOWER_<n> where <n> is the current asteroid tower inscribed in a sequence.

This collection is experimental and designed to push my understanding of inscriptions, and how they interact with the world.

# basic art process

1. Proto Towers of their respective ID number are the base image for each inscription.

2. If the Proto Tower has been burned because it was a mistake - I can do really fun things with those.

3. Take the base image, and then paint over it. That's it.

Right now I'm breaking the base image into a grid of panels and simplifying the Proto Tower by painting over the image with a very large, square paint brush.
I can see this process evolving over time, but for now this is fun.

For dividing grid patterns, the panel sizes can be calculated as follows:
size of image is normally 768x768
So if I wanted it to be 2 by 2 = we divide 768 by 2 to get

### GRID SETTINGS
FOR 768X768
12x12 = 64 pixel grid size
